            <h3 class="r"><strong>Rule No.1</strong> Use numbers from 1 to 9</h3>
            <container>
                Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be
                filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.

        <div class="rule2">
            <h3 class="r"><strong>Rule No.2</strong> Not to repeat any numbers</h3>
            <container>
                As you can see, in the upper left square (circled in blue), this square already has 4 out of the 9
                spaces filled in. The only numbers missing from the square are 2,3,4,5 and 7. By seeing which numbers
                are
                missing from each square, row, or column, we can use process of elimination and deductive reasoning to
                decide which numbers need to go in each blank space.

            <h3 class="r"><strong>Rule No.3</strong> Sudoku doesn't requires guessing</h3>
            <container>
                Sudoku is a game of logic and reasoning, so you shouldn’t have to guess. If you don’t know what number
                to put in a certain space, keep scanning the other areas of the grid until you seen an opportunity to
                place a number. But don’t try to “force” anything – Sudoku rewards patience, insights, and recognition
                of patterns, not blind luck or guessing.

            <h3 class="r"><strong>Rule No.4</strong> Use process of elimination</h3>
            <container>
                In this Sudoku grid (shown below), in the upper left square (circled in blue),it is missing only a few
                numbers: 2,3,4,5 and 7.
                One way to figure out which numbers can go in each space is to use “process of elimination” by checking
                to see which other numbers are already included within each square,since there can be no duplication of
                numbers 1-9 within each square (or row or column).
                <br>
                <img class="divs" src="images/rule4.png" alt="rule4">
                <br>
                In this case, we can quickly notice that there are already number 7s and 2s in the first row and
                first
                column of the Sudoku grid. This means that we are left with 3,4 and 5 to be filled in the
                top-left
                square.
                Now,observing the second column of the upper left square, we can't place 4 or 5,as it is already
                present
                in the entire column. Thus, we are left with 3 only to be filled at that position(circled in
                green).
                <br>
                This is how the process of
                elimination works in Sudoku – you find out which spaces are available, which numbers are missing
                – and
                then deduce, based on the position of those numbers within the grid, which numbers fit into each
                space.
